<h5>This project, which is a component of my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, aims to provide insights into the demographics, 
preferences, and work satisfaction of developers by analyzing and displaying the developer survey information. 
Through an examination of many variables like age, geography, work positions, and satisfaction levels, the study aims to identify
patterns and trends that might provide stakeholders with information regarding the present condition of the developer community.</h5>
